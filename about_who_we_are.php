                            <p>The pensions sector is one of the key non-banking financial sectors that is a source for
                                long term finance for investment. It is a long term savings vehicle that permits the
                                population to provide for old age retirement among others and a safety net in general
                                against a variety of unforeseen future consumption requirements. Currently, the pension
                                sector in Uganda is composed of; the Public Service Pension Scheme, which is a
                                Government scheme catering for the pensions of civil servants; the National Social
                                Security Funds, which receives mandatory pension contributions from all private sector
                                employers with five or more staff, and their employees; and a number of occupational
                                pension schemes to which various large employers and their employees make additional
                                contributions, over and above the NSSF mandatory contribution.</p>
